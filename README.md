# Questionaire
Made the created files
Used Bootstrap to get the look down
Made some minor changes to the JS
More slight tweaks to JS
Reworked the entire JS, Timer not working yet
Whole webpage doesn't work yet but made my if else statements
Focusing on the Timer now
Couldn't make the timer work but made one awnser button work
Everything looks right but I can't get anything it to work
Still having trouble on everything
if else statements work now!
Timer works now!
Done
